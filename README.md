# coolmath-games-snake-hack
Looks like coolmathgames.com snake but 'tab' adds length and 'w' toggles bottom tile of right wall for access outside of the game area

The black dot turns off if the specified wall tile is gone

To run click main.py

NOTE: Not actually chrome, just a screenshot, the only chrome controls that work are the 'x' button
